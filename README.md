# Personal Website

## Project Status: Finished (but will be improved)

### This repository is for my personal website to check it out, [CLICK HERE](https://sumanra.github.io/)

What I've done so far:

- I've studied basics of HTML5 and CSS3 then came across bootstrap4 framework which made it easier to create a website. It took me a while since I've tried to understand all different classes in bootstrap4 and how they work.
